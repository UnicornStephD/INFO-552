      <h1>Understanding the Program</h1>
      <p>Al-Anon is a program of spiritual growth — not quick fixes. Here's a gentle introduction.</p>

        <h3>The 12 Steps</h3>
        <p>The 12 Steps are a framework for personal healing and spiritual growth. Members are encouraged to work through them at their own pace. The steps invite self-reflection, acceptance, and a shift in focus — from trying to change others to changing ourselves.</p>

        <h3>The 12 Traditions</h3>
        <p>The Traditions support group unity and help ensure that meetings are safe, welcoming, and focused. They gently remind members that the group comes first, and that no one speaks for Al-Anon as a whole.</p>

        <h3>Key Concepts & Principles</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Detachment with love:</strong> Letting go of responsibility for others' choices while still caring about them</li>
          <li><strong>Boundaries:</strong> Learning what’s yours to carry — and what isn’t</li>
          <li><strong>One day at a time:</strong> Focusing on today’s actions, not yesterday’s mistakes or tomorrow’s worries</li>
          <li><strong>Letting go:</strong> Releasing control over outcomes, behaviors, and people you can’t change</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Many of these ideas can feel new or even confusing at first. It’s okay to grow into them gradually. You don’t have to do it perfectly — you just have to show up.</p>
