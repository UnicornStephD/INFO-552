      <h1>What is Al-Anon?</h1>
      <p>A community of mutual support for people affected by someone else’s drinking.</p>

        <p>Al-Anon is a worldwide fellowship that offers a safe, anonymous space for individuals who are impacted by the drinking behavior of a loved one — whether it's a partner, parent, sibling, friend, or anyone else in their life.</p>

        <p>It’s a program built on mutual support, shared experiences, and gentle guidance — not advice-giving or therapy. Members attend meetings to listen, learn, and connect with others who understand the stress, confusion, and pain of loving someone who drinks excessively.</p>

        <p>Al-Anon is not affiliated with any religion or political group, and it’s not professional counseling. Instead, it’s a spiritual program grounded in shared tools and values, offering long-term support through principles like acceptance, detachment with love, and personal growth.</p>

        <p>You don’t have to identify as being in crisis to attend. Many people join out of quiet concern, long-term frustration, or curiosity about healing — and that’s enough.</p>
