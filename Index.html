    <p>Did you know about 35–50% of all food produced is wasted? That's just sad. But much of what you toss into your kitchen's compost bin can actually be transformed into something delicious — as long as it's not already looking like a science experiment. In trying to curb my own family’s wastefulness, I turned to authors Giovanna Torrico and Amelia Wasiliev for inspiration.</p>

    <h3>The Zero Waste Cookbook</h3>
    <p>In their book, 
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Waste-Cookbook-Recipes-Cooking/dp/178488247X" target="_blank">
        The Zero Waste Cookbook: 100 Recipes for Cooking Without Waste
      </a>, 
      they share clever ways to reduce what you'd normally toss.</p>

    <p>Torrico and Wasiliev offer simple tips to shift our habits — from how and when we buy food to planning menus and storing leftovers. Their guidance includes sourcing locally, buying imperfect produce, utilizing the freezer, preserving scraps, and double-checking your pantry before shopping.</p>

    <p>The book is organized by categories like Vegetables, Fruit, Dairy & Eggs, Meat & Seafood, Bread & Pulses, and Leftovers. As they put it: if you buy good-quality local or organic produce, there’s no need to peel or discard the ends — just cook with them. Even tomato skins can be dehydrated and turned into a flavorful powder. Use it to add a tomatoey punch to marinades, dips, or homemade chips.</p>

    <p>Herb stems can be infused into oil or sparkling water. Cores of lettuce and cruciferous veggies become delicious when grilled. Even kale, chard, carrot, and cucumber scraps can be pickled. One of my favorite tips is their Bare Corn-on-the-Cob Stock — a flavorful base for soups or risottos made from leftover corn cobs.</p>

    <p>Ready to try it for yourself? This Mixed Herb Stem Salsa Verde is a flavorful way to start. After making it, you’ll never toss a herb stem again.</p>

    <h3>Mixed Herb Stem Salsa Verde</h3>
    <p><i>"Salsa Verde is great served with meat, fish, or roasted vegetables. You can also serve it on crostini or use it as a sandwich spread." – Torrico and Wasiliev</i></p>
    <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 125 ml (4 fl oz / ½ cup)</p>
    <p><strong>Prep:</strong> 15 minutes &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Rest:</strong> 2 hours</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>30 g (1 oz) stale bread</li>
      <li>100 g (3½ oz) mixed soft fresh herb stems (e.g., parsley, basil, mint)</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove</li>
      <li>1 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 anchovies</li>
      <li>40 ml (1¾ fl oz / 2½ tbsp) extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to cover</li>
      <li>Sea salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p>Soak the bread in warm water. Wash the herb stems and place them in a food processor with the garlic, vinegar, anchovies, and olive oil. Pulse to lightly blend. Squeeze the water from the bread and add it to the mixture. Blend again to create a creamy but not overly thick sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Cover with a thin layer of oil and refrigerate for 2 hours. Will keep in the fridge for up to one week.</p>
