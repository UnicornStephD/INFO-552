      <h1>Is Al-Anon Right for Me?</h1>
      <p>Al-Anon welcomes anyone whose life has been affected by someone else's drinking — in any way, at any stage.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <div class="text-block">
        <p>If you’ve ever felt:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Confused about how to help someone who drinks too much</li>
          <li>Frustrated by broken promises, mood swings, or chaos caused by drinking</li>
          <li>Exhausted from trying to “hold it all together”</li>
          <li>Worried, anxious, or resentful — even when things seem “fine” on the surface</li>
          <li>Like you’re always waiting for the next crisis or letdown</li>
          <li>Alone in your experience or ashamed to talk about it</li>
        </ul>

        <p>— then you are not alone. Many people in Al-Anon started with these same feelings.</p>

        <p>You don’t have to label anyone or define their behavior. Al-Anon isn't about diagnosing others — it’s about finding your own peace and clarity, regardless of what someone else chooses to do.</p>

        <p>There’s no cost to attend a meeting. You can listen quietly, share if you wish, and explore whether the support feels helpful. Many people attend a few meetings before they feel ready to engage — and that’s perfectly okay.</p>
