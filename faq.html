      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p>Answers to some common concerns about attending Al-Anon.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <div class="text-block">
        <h3>Do I have to talk at my first meeting?</h3>
        <p>Nope. You are welcome to just listen. Many people attend several meetings before they feel comfortable sharing, and that’s completely okay.</p>

        <h3>Is Al-Anon only for spouses of alcoholics?</h3>
        <p>Not at all. Al-Anon is for anyone affected by someone else’s drinking — including parents, siblings, adult children, friends, and more.</p>

        <h3>Do I have to believe in God to attend?</h3>
        <p>No. Al-Anon is a spiritual, not religious, program. You are encouraged to define a “Higher Power” in your own way — or not at all. People of all (or no) faith backgrounds are welcome.</p>

        <h3>Will I be judged for talking about my situation?</h3>
        <p>No. Al-Anon meetings are confidential and nonjudgmental. Everyone is there to focus on their own recovery — not to critique yours.</p>

        <h3>How do I find the right meeting for me?</h3>
        <p>There are many types of meetings — in person, online, phone-based. It’s okay to try different ones until you find a group that feels like a good fit.</p>
