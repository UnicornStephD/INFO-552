      <h1>For Loved Ones of Al-Anon Participants</h1>
      <p>Understanding and supporting someone attending Al-Anon — without overstepping.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <div class="text-block">
        <p>When someone you care about starts attending Al-Anon, it can raise questions. What are they learning? Why do they go? Is something wrong?</p>

        <p>Al-Anon is a program designed for people affected by someone else’s drinking. It helps members focus on their own well-being rather than trying to fix or manage another person’s behavior. This might be a shift — especially if your relationship has included shared worry or problem-solving.</p>

        <h3>What You Might Notice</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>They may start setting healthier boundaries</li>
          <li>They might speak less about the drinker and more about their own feelings</li>
          <li>They may talk about concepts like “detachment” or “letting go”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This doesn’t mean they love anyone less. It means they’re learning to take care of themselves — something many people struggle with when dealing with someone else’s drinking.</p>

        <h3>How You Can Support Them</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Respect their privacy — meetings are anonymous, and they may not want to share every detail</li>
          <li>Let them grow in their own time — recovery is a personal process</li>
          <li>Avoid giving advice unless asked — listening is often the most loving thing you can do</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you find yourself deeply affected too, you're not alone. You may even consider attending a meeting yourself to better understand what your loved one is learning — or simply to find your own support.</p>
